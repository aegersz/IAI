# Interconnected Artificial Intelligence (IAI) - Pseudologic

## 1. System Overview
IAI is a decentralized AI system consisting of interconnected nodes, each with predefined roles, sharing a common knowledge base and utilizing Dynamic Machine Learning (DML) for continuous adaptation.

## 2. Core Components
### 2.1 AI Nodes
- **Types of Nodes:**
  - **Data Collector Nodes** → Gather real-time data via web crawlers, APIs, and structured sources.
  - **Processing Nodes** → Analyze, filter, and structure raw data.
  - **Knowledge Nodes** → Store and retrieve processed data for system-wide access.
  - **Decision Nodes** → Apply logic, reasoning, and inference on knowledge to generate insights.
  - **Action Nodes** → Execute commands, automate tasks, and provide outputs.

- **Node Communication:**  
  - Nodes interact through a message-passing protocol.
  - Requests and responses follow a structured schema.
  - Nodes prioritize information based on relevance and accuracy.

### 2.2 Knowledge Base
- A centralized or distributed database storing:
  - Verified facts, learned patterns, and historical interactions.
  - Metadata for tracking data reliability and context.

- **Access Model:**
  - Nodes retrieve knowledge via API-like calls.
  - Data integrity is maintained via consensus mechanisms.

### 2.3 Dynamic Machine Learning (DML)
- **Retraining Mechanism:**
  - Nodes continuously update their models based on new data.
  - Feedback loops ensure models remain relevant and accurate.

- **Adaptation Process:**
  - Outdated or inaccurate knowledge is flagged and corrected.
  - Weighting system prioritizes reliable sources.

### 2.4 Web Crawlers
- **Purpose:**
  - Extract real-time data from structured and semi-structured sources.
  - Feed collected data to processing nodes for analysis.

- **Filtering Mechanism:**
  - Prevent noise and irrelevant information from entering the system.
  - Ensure compliance with legal and ethical data usage.

## 3. Workflow
1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Data Collector Nodes gather information from multiple sources.  
2. **Processing & Structuring:**  
   - Processing Nodes clean and transform data into a structured format.  
3. **Knowledge Integration:**  
   - Knowledge Nodes store structured information for system-wide access.  
4. **Decision Making:**  
   - Decision Nodes analyze the knowledge base and generate insights.  
5. **Execution:**  
   - Action Nodes apply decisions to perform tasks or respond to queries.  
6. **Continuous Learning:**  
   - The system updates models dynamically based on feedback and new data.  

## 4. Scalability & Redundancy
- **Scalability:**  
  - More nodes can be added to distribute workload dynamically.  
- **Redundancy:**  
  - Backup knowledge nodes prevent data loss.
  - Multiple decision nodes cross-check critical outputs.

## 5. Security & Ethics
- **Access Control:**  
  - Restrict unauthorized data modification.  
- **Bias Mitigation:**  
  - Use diverse datasets to prevent biased learning.  
- **Transparency:**  
  - Maintain logs of decisions and learning updates.
