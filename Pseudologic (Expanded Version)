1. System Initialization

Load configuration files (e.g., config.yaml).

Initialize logging and error handling.

Set up networking for inter-node communication.

Check system hardware resources (CPU, GPU, memory, bandwidth).

Load pre-trained AI models and knowledge base.


2. Node Management & Load Balancing

Detect available computing nodes (local & remote).

Assign roles to nodes:

Master Node (coordinates tasks).

Worker Nodes (execute tasks).

Crawler Nodes (fetch data).


Monitor node health and redistribute workload if a node fails.


3. Web Crawling & Data Collection

Load crawler settings from config.yaml.

Schedule crawling tasks (Bing, Google, APIs).

Extract, clean, and store structured & unstructured data.

Avoid duplicate requests and respect robots.txt.


4. Machine Learning & Knowledge Base Management

Load & preprocess data.

Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Train models using distributed training if needed.

Store results in a distributed knowledge base.

Regularly update models to improve accuracy.


5. Interconnected AI Logic

AI nodes communicate via message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).

Shared knowledge base is accessed & updated by nodes.

Each node can query other nodes for insights, facts, or data processing.

Implement a consensus mechanism to prevent conflicting results.


6. API & User Interaction

Provide a REST API or WebSocket for external apps.

Implement a command-line interface (CLI) for debugging & monitoring.

Allow users to customize training settings via configuration files.


7. Scalability & Future Extensions

Support dynamic node addition/removal.

Implement security measures (authentication, encryption).

Allow for plugin-based extensions for additional functionality.
