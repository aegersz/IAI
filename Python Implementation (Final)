/*
Summary of Updates:

1. Expanded Python Code:

Emulates a network of AI nodes across VMs.

Each node has a role (ML Trainer or Web Crawler).

Load balancing is implemented to distribute tasks evenly across nodes.

A basic web crawling mechanism is simulated.

Training tasks are split across nodes for distributed machine learning.



2. Configuration File:

YAML format for easy configuration of AI nodes, roles, network, and load balancing.

Configuration for enabling/disabling web crawling and training tasks, with parameters like batch size and epochs.



3. Python Implementation:

Python code is structured to read the configuration file and initialize the system accordingly.

Simulates training across distributed nodes and performs web crawling tasks.
