# Interconnected Artificial Intelligence (IAI)

IAI is a system of interconnected AI nodes with predefined roles, shared knowledge bases, and Dynamic Machine Learning (DML) logic. It utilizes web crawlers for real-time data integration.

## Features
- **Node-based AI system** with predefined roles
- **Shared knowledge base** for seamless learning
- **Dynamic Machine Learning (DML)** with continuous retraining
- **Web crawlers** (e.g., MS Bing, Google bots) for real-time data

## Structure
- `pseudologic/` - Conceptual logic breakdown
- `pseudocode/` - High-level implementation plan
- `src/` - Python codebase
